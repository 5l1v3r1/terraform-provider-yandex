# yandex\_compute\_instance

Get information about a Yandex Compute Instance. For more information see
[the official documentation](https://cloud.yandex.com/docs/compute/concepts/vm).

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "yandex_compute_instance" "my_instance" {
  instance_id = "some_instance_id"
}

output "instance_external_ip" {
  value = "${data.yandex_compute_instance.my_instance.network_interface.0.nat_ip_address}"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `instance_id` - (Required) The ID of a specific instance.

## Attributes Reference

* `name` - Name of the instance.
* `description` - Description of the instance.
* `folder_id` - ID of the folder that the instance belongs to.
* `fqdn` - FQDN of the instance.
* `zone` - Availability zone where the instance resides.
* `labels` - A set of key/value label pairs to assign to the instance.
* `metadata` - Metadata key/value pairs to make available from
    within the instance.
* `platform_id` - Type of the virtual machine to create. Default is 'standard-v1'.
* `status` - Status of the instance.
* `resources.0.memory` - Memory size allocated for instance.
* `resources.0.cores` - Number of CPU cores allocated for instance.
* `resources.0.core_fraction` - Baseline performance for a core set in percent.
* `boot_disk` - The boot disk for the instance. Structure is documented below.
* `secondary_disk` - List of secondary disks attached to the instance. Structure is documented below.
* `network_interface` - The networks attached to the instance. Structure is documented below.
* `network_interface.0.ip_address` - An internal IP address of the instance, either manually or dynamically assigned.
* `network_interface.0.nat_ip_address` - An assigned external IP address if the instance has an NAT enabled.
* `created_at` - Instance creation timestamp.

The `boot_disk` block supports:

* `auto_delete` - Whether the disk is auto-deleted when the instance is deleted. The default value is false.
* `device_name` - Name that can be used to access an attached disk
    under `/dev/disk/by-id/`.
* `mode` - Access mode to the Disk resource. By default a disk is attached in `READ_WRITE` mode.
* `disk_id` -
* `initialize_params` - Parameters with which a disk was created alongside the instance.
    The structure is documented below.

The `initialize_params` block supports:

* `name` - Name of the boot disk.
* `description` - Description of the boot disk.
* `size` - Size of the disk in GB.
* `type_id` - Disk type.
* `image_id` - A disk image to initialize this disk from.
* `snapshot_id` - A snapshot to initialize this disk from.

The `network_interface` block supports:

* `index` - The index of the network interface, generated by the server.
* `mac_address` - MAC address that is assigned to the network interface.
* `ip_address` - The private IP address to assign to the instance. If empty, the address is automatically assigned from the specified subnet.
* `subnet_id` - ID of the subnet to attach this interface to. The subnet must reside in the same zone where this instance created in.
* `nat` - Assigned for instance public address, that is used to access the Internet through NAT.
* `nat_ip_address` - Public IP address of the instance.
* `nat_ip_version` - IP version for public address.
* `ipv6` - If IPv6 address present.
* `ipv6_address` - An assigned IPv6 address if the instance has an IPv6 support enabled.

The `secondary_disk` block supports:

* `auto_delete` - Specifies whether the disk is auto-deleted when the instance is deleted.
* `device_name` - This value can be used to reference the device for mounting, resizing, and so on, from within the instance.
* `mode` - Access mode to the Disk resource. By default, a disk attached in `READ_WRITE` mode.
* `disk_id` - ID of the disk that is attached to the instance.
